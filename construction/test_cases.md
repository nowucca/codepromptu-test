Based on the API functionalities provided, let's outline some English descriptions of test case groups and their respective test scenarios. Each group will focus on a specific aspect of the API's capabilities, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

### Test Group: Prompt Creation and Retrieval

1. **Test Case: Creating and Retrieving a Public Prompt**
   - **Given**: Alice creates a public prompt with specific content, display name, and tags.
   - **When**: Alice retrieves the prompt by its GUID.
   - **Then**: The retrieved prompt matches the created one in content, display name, and tags.

2. **Test Case: Creating and Retrieving a Private Prompt**
   - **Given**: Bob creates a private prompt with specific content, display name, and tags.
   - **When**: Bob retrieves the prompt by its GUID.
   - **Then**: The retrieved prompt matches the created one in content, display name, and tags.

### Test Group: Prompt Visibility and Access Control

1. **Test Case: Accessing Private Prompt Created by Another User**
   - **Given**: Bob creates a private prompt.
   - **When**: Alice tries to retrieve Bob's private prompt by its GUID.
   - **Then**: Alice receives an access denied error or an indication that the prompt does not exist.

2. **Test Case: Accessing Public Prompt Created by Another User**
   - **Given**: Alice creates a public prompt.
   - **When**: Bob retrieves the prompt created by Alice using its GUID.
   - **Then**: Bob successfully retrieves the prompt, verifying its content, display name, and tags.

### Test Group: Prompt Modification and Deletion

1. **Test Case: Updating and Verifying a Prompt**
   - **Given**: Alice creates a public prompt.
   - **When**: Alice updates the prompt's content, display name, and tags.
   - **Then**: Alice retrieves the prompt and verifies that the updates are reflected accurately.

2. **Test Case: Deleting a Prompt and Ensuring Deletion**
   - **Given**: Bob creates a private prompt.
   - **When**: Bob deletes the prompt.
   - **Then**: Attempting to retrieve the prompt results in a not found error or similar response.

### Test Group: Tag Management

1. **Test Case: Adding and Verifying Tags on a Prompt**
   - **Given**: Alice creates a public prompt without tags.
   - **When**: Alice adds one or more tags to the prompt.
   - **Then**: Alice retrieves the prompt and verifies that the tags have been added successfully.

2. **Test Case: Removing and Verifying Tags on a Prompt**
   - **Given**: Bob creates a private prompt with multiple tags.
   - **When**: Bob removes one or more tags from the prompt.
   - **Then**: Bob retrieves the prompt and verifies that the tags have been removed successfully.

### Test Group: Listing and Filtering Prompts by Tags

1. **Test Case: Listing Prompts by a Specific Tag**
   - **Given**: Multiple prompts are created by Alice and Bob, some of which share a specific tag.
   - **When**: A list of prompts is retrieved by filtering with the specific tag.
   - **Then**: Only the prompts that contain the specific tag are listed.

2. **Test Case: Verifying Empty Results When Filtering by an Unused Tag**
   - **Given**: A set of prompts is created without a specific tag.
   - **When**: A list of prompts is retrieved by filtering with the unused tag.
   - **Then**: The result set is empty, indicating no prompts are associated with the unused tag.

These test case descriptions lay the foundation for developing detailed, executable test cases in the test case layer, ensuring each aspect of the API's functionality is thoroughly validated.
