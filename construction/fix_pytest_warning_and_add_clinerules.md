# Fixing Pytest-Asyncio Warning and Adding Cline Rules

## Pytest-Asyncio Configuration

### Issue
The project was experiencing a deprecation warning from pytest-asyncio:

```
PytestDeprecationWarning: The configuration option "asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope" is unset.
The event loop scope for asynchronous fixtures will default to the fixture caching scope. Future versions of pytest-asyncio will default the loop scope for asynchronous fixtures to function scope. Set the default fixture loop scope explicitly in order to avoid unexpected behavior in the future. Valid fixture loop scopes are: "function", "class", "module", "package", "session"
```

### Solution
Created a `pytest.ini` file in the project root with the following configuration:

```ini
[pytest]
asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = function
```

This explicitly sets the loop scope to function level, which:
1. Matches the existing fixture scopes in base_test.py
2. Ensures consistent behavior with future versions of pytest-asyncio
3. Eliminates the deprecation warning

## Cline Rules Configuration

### Purpose
Added a `.clinerules` file to help the Cline AI assistant better understand the project structure, coding standards, and terminology.

### Implementation
Created a `.clinerules` file in the project root with configurations for:

1. Project purpose and focus
   - Practice generating comprehensive test cases for API interactions
   - Target system: aitools.cs.vt.edu:8000
   - Primary focus: testing

2. Python coding standards
   - Style guidelines (line length, quotes, docstrings)
   - Import organization

3. Testing standards and patterns
   - Framework: pytest with pytest-asyncio
   - Required Given-When-Then docstring format
   - Test file naming and location conventions
   - Test case organization patterns

4. System architecture understanding
   - Layer structure (client, session, test)
   - API endpoint information

5. Project-specific terminology
   - Definitions for domain-specific terms

6. Directory purposes
   - Mapping of directories to their functional roles

### Benefits
The `.clinerules` file will make Cline more effective when:
- Generating new test cases that follow the Given-When-Then format
- Understanding the relationships between code layers
- Maintaining consistent coding standards
- Using correct terminology in generated code and explanations
