# Project purpose and focus
project:
  purpose: "Practice generating comprehensive test cases for API interactions"
  target_system: "aitools.cs.vt.edu:8000"
  primary_focus: "testing"

# General Python coding standards
python:
  style:
    max_line_length: 88  # Black default
    quote_style: double  # Prefer double quotes for strings
    docstring_style: """  # Triple double quotes for docstrings
  
  imports:

# Testing standards and patterns
testing:
  framework: pytest
  async_framework: pytest-asyncio
  docstring_format: "Given-When-Then"  # Required format for test docstrings
  test_file_naming: "test_*.py"  # Test files should be named test_*.py
  test_location: "api/test/"  # All tests should be in api/test directory
  
  # Test case organization
  test_case_patterns:
    - functional_grouping: true  # Group related tests in the same file
    - sensible_naming: true  # Use descriptive, action-oriented names
    - complete_coverage: true  # Aim for thorough coverage of functionality
  
  # Test docstring requirements
  docstring_sections:
    - given: "Initial state/context"
    - when: "Action being tested"
    - then: "Expected outcome/assertion"

# System architecture understanding

# Project-specific terminology
terminology:
  prompt: "A text template stored in the system"
